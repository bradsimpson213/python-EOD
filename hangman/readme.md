# Hangman (in the terminal)

## Instructions

1. There is a starter file for you with some code already implemented
2. You could either use functions or a class to make the game (but certainly one is a more OOP approach)


## Included Files

1. `words.txt` should be used as your source of words for the game
2. `stages.py` is a list of ascii art to use as your display for the hangman
3. `hangman_starter.py` is where you should implement all your game logic
